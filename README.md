# üíª Operating System Lab

This repository contains a collection of practical assignments implemented in C, designed to reinforce theoretical concepts from an Operating Systems course. The exercises cover topics such as process management, thread creation, memory and file handling, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and shell scripting.

> ‚úÖ Each subdirectory represents a separate topic with self-contained C programs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To compile and run any `.c` file:

```bash
gcc -o output_file source_file.c -pthread
./output_file
```

Example:

```bash
gcc -o multi_thread thread/multi_thread.c -pthread
./multi_thread
```

> Ensure you have a POSIX-compliant OS (e.g., Linux) and GCC installed.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

* GCC compiler with pthread support
* Basic understanding of C and operating system fundamentals
* Linux or Unix-like terminal
